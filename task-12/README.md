# Python Source
In this program we were given the coded version of the string and the method in which it was coded was given in the reverse_me.py but the problem in the program was in Python2 and I converted it to Python3.In which a lot of problem was faced in the encode function.While decoding I also discovered the xor and de_xor were the same function.
