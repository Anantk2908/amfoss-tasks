# Project Euler
## #1
In this we were supposed to tell what was the sum of the all the multiples of 3 and 5 under a given element n.So for this question a for loop along with a if statement which appends the multiples of 3 and 5 to a list.Then, using another for 
loop adding all the elements in that list.

## #2
In this question we were supposed to print the sum of the even number which are less than the inputted number.So using the function create_fib I created a fibonacci sequence which has ters less than inputted number after that I printed the sum of the even terms.

## #3
In this question we were supposed to print largest prime factor of the number inputted.So first using for loops I created a 2d array of all the prime factors of the all the test cases.Then printed the max of each one them using a for loop.
