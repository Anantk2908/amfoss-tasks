# Pong Game
In this task we were supposed to make a pong game in javascript.So first I reated a rectangle using html.Then using javascript I created the user paddle and the com paddle then using the logic that if the ball hits the paddle at the height above the half the height of the paddle it deflects at an angle of 45 degrees and if the ball hits the paddle below the half of the paddle then it deflects at an angle of 45 degrees. 


The game is currently hosted at https://anantk2908.github.io/pong_game/
